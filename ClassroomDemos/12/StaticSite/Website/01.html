<h3>Web Servers and Clients</h3>
<p>This book will show you how to build web applications which will run on a 
phone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer.  This same app will accommodate
the display size of the device being used.  This layout of all the views will
change to match the device.  This is called responsive web design.</p>
<p>Web apps are the primary way that people interact with servers today.
The devices that users interact with (mobile, laptops, or desktops) are called
clients, while the remote computers are called servers.  This Client/Server 
architecture is fundamental to the internet.</p>
<p>The internet is a gigantic network that allows servers to be accessed from 
anywhere in the world. Commercial routers provide addressing to get to a 
specific machine from a client devices.   A URL (Uniform Resource Locater) is
an address to get to a specific machine page or resource on some machine
on the internet.</p>
<p>A web server is software that runs on a remote computer that responds to a
request for a URL and generates a response which is sent back to the client.
The client makes a request and the server sends a response.  The client software
then displays the response to the user. A web browser is the software that
displays the responses to the user and allows users to make web requests.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/WebServer.png" /></p>
<h3>Building Web Apps</h3>
<p>Throughout this book you will learn how to build a web application.  There are
two types of web servers on the internet.  Some server simply return files for
the requests that are made.  These files might be HTML, JavaScript, Images, or
other assets types, but they are always static.  We call these static web servers
since that just respond with static information.</p>
<p>Dynamic web servers on the other hand are far more interesting.  They receive
web requests and may do complex calculations and store data in a database.<br />
For each request the server must create an appropriate response and may need to
invoke other computers in the process.</p>
<p>Static web servers have a use but are quite limited in their capability.  Dynamic
servers allow the programmer to perform any kind of work needed to create the
appropriate response.  To build a web application requires a dynamic server
which executes code to generate the response usually working with a database.</p>
<p>The pages are generated by code written in a general
programming language
such as Python, JavaScript, C#, or Java.</p>
<h3>Common Web App</h3>
<p>I've been building web pages and applications since the beginning of the internet
and have written over fifty complete applications.  I have had commercial 
experience with all of the most common languages and frameworks for creating
web apps.  </p>
<p>Years ago, I noticed that most web apps have very common features
to all of the other apps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile device app</li>
<li>Front-end (user experience)</li>
<li>Business logic</li>
<li>Database</li>
</ul>
<h3>Front-end/Back-end</h3>
<p>Web development has gotten surprisingly sophisticated and complex.  When the
browser software began to execute JavaScript code, a lot of software logic 
migrated from the server to the client.  Web pages were no longer simple static
assets that were displayed by the browser.  Now complex code logic was sent 
from the server to be executed in the client browser.</p>
<p>Eventually this took on the name of Front-end development.  Powerful JavaScript
frameworks were increasingly used to create a dynamic user experience that
runs on the client side of the internet.</p>
<p>Back-end Development focuses on the code logic that runs on the server.  This
usually revolves around the database and may include a web service API to
communicate with other computers.  The back-end software is typically built
using a framework that performs all of the common tasks.</p>
<p>Full-stack development involves both the front end and the back end.  Sometimes 
these are separated out into different responsibilities.  A full-stack developer
must be able to operate across the full range of languages and frameworks.</p>
<p>Modern web development is not based on a single tool but rather a stack of 
interdependent tools.  The first decision to be made on a project is what tool
stack to use.</p>
<h3>Tool Stack</h3>
<p>For our web development we will be using the following tools.  We will be doing 
back-end development (server side code)</p>
<ul>
<li>VS Code - Development Environment</li>
<li>Django - Web Development Framework</li>
<li>Python - Programming Language</li>
<li>MySQL - Database</li>
</ul>
<h3>Web Frameworks</h3>
<p>There are many reasons to use a web framework. It gives us reusable code that
quickly lets you build an app.  This code solves all the common problems.  We
leverage tens-of-thousands of hours of effort.  This let's us write about 
10% of the code needed for our application.</p>
<p>Other Frameworks and Languages</p>
<ul>
<li>.Net - C#</li>
<li>Rails - Ruby</li>
<li>Laravel - PHP</li>
<li>Django - Python</li>
</ul>
<h3>Development Tools</h3>
<p>There is a wide variety of great tools available to work with Django applications.
For this class I have selected the best tools which balance ease of learning
with robust power.  This lets you get up and running but also to scale your
efforts as needed.</p>
<p>There are several tools in our development stack starting with low-level and 
moving to higher levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux kernel - with WSL on MS Windows OS</li>
<li>Homebrew - application manager for installing tools</li>
<li>pyenv - tool to manage Python Virtual Environments</li>
<li>Django - web application framework</li>
<li>Git - version control system</li>
<li>Github - web service to manage Git repositories</li>
<li>Microsoft Visual Studio Code -  integrated development environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these tools must be install and set up in order to provide a powerful
platform on which to build our application code.  There are many tools other 
than these which could be used.  But these tools are proven to get you up and
running with the least amount of work.</p>
<p>We will take these tools in three chunks.</p>
<ul>
<li>VS Code</li>
<li>Github Repo</li>
<li>Python Environment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Python for our Project</h3>
<p>All systems ship with some version of Python installed. People are tempted to
use this version but it may lead to disaster.  The pre-installed Python is 
intended to allow users on the system to execute automatic tools but not to 
develop new application code.  Don't use the system version of Python.</p>
<p>We will install a fresh version of Python that is the latest and greatest. 
Then we will install on top of that version all of the needed libraries that
we intend to use.  This version of Python will be totally isolated from all
the other versions of Python and have its own lifecycle.</p>
<h3>Virtual Environments</h3>
<p>You may need many different Python environments for different Python packages.
Each environment may use entirely different packages.<br />
Python provides Virtual Environments to isolate projects from each other.
Over time we may have many virtual environments on the computer but they will
never interfere with each other.</p>
<p>Activating a Virtual Environment means setting up a particular environment to
use from all of the commands that we execute. Each work session starts by
activating the environment.</p>
<p>All work in Python should be done in a virtual environment. This lets you use different
libraries for each project. We will be using a tool "pyenv" to setup and
activate our virtual environment for us.  This will save us some extra work
and prevent errors.</p>
<h3>Development Workflow</h3>
<p>During development you will be writing code in small increments for each feature.
Every feature will be created, tested, fixed, and committed to version control
before moving on to the next.
Working in this way will ensure that your code is always getting better and
never broken.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit</strong> - make a small (1-3 lines) change to your code</li>
<li><strong>Test</strong> - run the server and browse to page</li>
<li><strong>Commit</strong> - commit changes every hour</li>
<li><strong>Repeat</strong> - work in small iteration, don't ignore bugs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Django Projects</h3>
<p>Django is a web development framework that contributes all of the generic 
code logic for your applications.  You will create a Django project that will
be deployed on an application service (such as AWS, Google App Engine, or 
Digital Ocean).  You will use the features in the Django Framework to quickly
build your custom application.</p>
<p>During development you will build reusable logic specific to your application.
Django provides an easy way to reuse code in other projects by encapsulating
them as modules called "Apps".  A Django project is built from one or more 
apps.  The reuse of the "app" name is somewhat unfortunate and causes some 
confusion for learning Django initially.  </p>
<p>Just remember a Django Project (Application) is built from multiple Apps (Django
component modules).  We will spend a lot of time working with this and it will
become obvious very quickly.</p>
<h3>Building an App</h3>
<p>Each Django App is a reusable component module with its own data and views.
To build an App we typically need to create several unique files that reference
each other.</p>
<ul>
<li>URL Routes - which pages are handled</li>
<li>Views - format the response for the request</li>
<li>Templates - HTML content in the page</li>
<li>Data Models (if using a database)</li>
</ul>
<p>We will look at all this in detail in later chapters.  For now just be aware
that creating an App involves several unique pieces of code.</p>
<h3>Setting Up Development Tools</h3>
<p>Before we build an application using Django we need to setup an environment 
that will support our code development.  There are several different tools that
need to be configured.  These are presented as specific skills with step-by-step
instructions. Go through these one at a time.  Do not go on to the next one
until you are sure that you have it right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Python Environment</li>
<li>Development Server</li>
</ul>
<h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p>There are many great development tools that are available for building 
applications.  Feel free to use any tool that you are already comfortable with.
For this book we will standardize on Microsoft Visual Studio Code.  Other
popular tools include Sublime Text and PyCharm.</p>
<p>VS Code is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that has at its heart
a programmer's editor.   But it also provides many advanced tools that will 
make your live easy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Color syntax highlighting to help you write code</li>
<li>Code completion</li>
<li>Static analysis</li>
<li>Framework for running tests</li>
<li>Framework to run server</li>
<li>and much, much more</li>
</ul>
<p>Your first task will be to install VS code on your computer and get it configured
properly.  Skill #1 will walk you through this setup.</p>
<h3>Git</h3>
<p>Git is the industry standard for version control systems. There are dozens of
systems available but Git is the unchallenged leader.
Linus Torvalds created Git while he was writing Linux.  Yes the same guy that
gave us Linux also built Git.  He felt that other versioning systems lacked the
features that would allow then to accommodate extremely large projects with
thousands of developers.</p>
<p>Git allow users to work individually or with thousands of developers.  Work is
merged together to form new versions of the code.  Any version in history can 
be achieved instantly and when changes were introduced are easy to see and review.</p>
<p>Save every version of every file while you work.  Use good comments on every 
commit. Put everything under version control</p>
<h3>Github</h3>
<p>Github is the best version control service available to manage Git code 
repositories.  It is a web service that hosts thousands of users and millions of
projects. By January 2020, Github had 40 million users, over 100 million
repositories.</p>
<p>You can work with the website directly to manage your code.
More commonly Git repos are cloned onto your local computer and then changes
are synched back to Github.</p>
<p>You will setup a git repository stored at Github that will be used for all the
code you write in this course.   All grading will be done by examining the
code in this Git repo.</p>
<p>In the commercial world all work is shared by using Git repositories hosted
at a web service (such as Github or BitBucket). This is a good practice to
get used to now.</p>
<h3>Code Sharing</h3>
<p>Programming projects typically start with existing code from someone else. By
cloning a repo you can get a copy of the code to work with on your local 
computer.  Your changes are mixed in with the other changes that occur on the
repo that you cloned.  To get these changes you do a "git pull".</p>
<p>To share the changes you make with others you do a "git push" command. This merges
your recently committed changes back to the repo that you cloned from.  You 
are only permitted to do this if you have permissions to the remote repository.</p>
<p>If you are starting with someone else's code then you need to "Fork" the 
repository.  This creates a new repository that you own.  You can push new
changes to your repository without affecting the one that you forked from.
New changes to the upstream repo can be pulled to keep your forked repo updated.</p>
<p>I have created a repo at "https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/BACS350".  You will 
fork this repo to create "https://github.com/<your-name>/BACS350".  You will
clone this repo on your local computer and use "git pull" and "git push" to 
sync your changes.</p>
<p>Skill #2 gives you step-by-step instructions for how to setup your repositories
at Github and on your local computer.</p>
<h3>Python Environment</h3>
<p>Every modern computer is shipping with Python built in.  This Python environment
is not intended for you to build applications.  It is meant to execute simple
scripts to do tasks for system administration.</p>
<p>When you are doing application development you need to have complete control
of the Python version that you are running as well as all of the packages that
are needed for your application.  Don't use the Python version that ships with 
your system.  This may lead to breaking your system.</p>
<p>You will likely build many applications that will have very different packages
that they depend on.  So configure an environment for each
application.  Python defines an mechanism for isolating the applications from
one another.</p>
<h3>Virtual Environment</h3>
<p>Set up a Virtual Environment for each major project that you create.  Select
the Python version to use and install all of the require packages within this
Virtual Environment.</p>
<p>We start by creating a Virtual Environment and then activating it.  Once this
is done we can install all the packages that we need.</p>
<pre><code>$ python -m venv .venv

$ source .venv/bin/activate      # On Mac
$ source .venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows
</code></pre>
<h3>Installing Python Packages</h3>
<p>PIP is the Package Installer for Python.  It will be used to setup the virtual
environment for development.  The only package we need to start out is Django.</p>
<p>Activate the Virtual Environment before installing the packages. Install the
Django libraries into the Virtual Environment.</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install django
</code></pre>
<h3>Development Server</h3>
<p>The Django Framework provides its own web server to let you run your code 
to test it out during development.  This works great for trying out ideas on
your local computer.  </p>
<p>In Chapter 2 we will cover how to set up an App Server Hosting environment to
make your application visible on the internet.  For now, we will focus on 
running your app on your own computer using the Django Development server.
Go to the directory with "manage.py" and execute ...</p>
<pre><code>$ python manage.py runserver
</code></pre>
<p>This launches the development server so that you can view the web pages in your
browser.  Skill #1 provides you with step-by-step instructions to set up your 
Python environment to the point where you can run Django code.  Make sure you
setup all the tools properly before you try to run the code.</p>
<p>Test the application code in the repo at
"https://github.com/<your-name>/BACS350/week1/ProfileApp" to verify your 
Django setup. Keep 
working on it until shows the profile page along with the image and stylesheet.<br />
In the next chapter we'll see 
how to take this app into the wilds of the internet.</p>
