<h3>CRUD views</h3>
<p>Django provides an easy way to implement a full set of views to work on a
specific data type.  In the last chapter we looked at how all of the operations
on our database records involve the four basic CRUD operations.  In this
chapter we will see how to create views that support each operation.</p>
<p>When building views for data types start by defining the data model.  Select
which key data attributes are needed on the data model to implement the desired
business rules.  Simplify the design by calculating the attributes that can
be computed, so that you only store the independent variables in the database.</p>
<h3>Data CRUD Views Design Pattern</h3>
<p>Now you can build views for the following data model without writing very much code.
Each record type needs to be created, read, updated, and deleted.  This means
that we will need to consider five different views for each data model in
our application.  We may not need to implement all of the fews depending on
the functionality of our app.</p>
<p>Implementing a view requires inheriting from the appropriate Django view class
and providing the unique details that are specific to your needs.  At a minimum
this involves specifying the data model and the HTML template to use.
You can also add other variable content to be passed into the view.  We will
start by assuming the most basic implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>CreateView</li>
<li>ListView</li>
<li>DetailView</li>
<li>UpdateView</li>
<li>DeleteView</li>
</ul>
<h3>Database Migration</h3>
<p>In the last chapter we created the initial database tables by using the migrate
command in Django.  This applied the code within the migrations scripts to
the actual SQL database.</p>
<p>This same command will be used to make changes to the database to match the 
new data models within our code.  Each time we make changes to the data models
we must make new migrations scripts.  This compares the current tables with the
current data models and builds the Python scripts to change the database.</p>
<pre><code>$ python manage.py makemigrations
</code></pre>
<p>After creating new migrations they must be applied.</p>
<pre><code>$ python manage.py migrate
</code></pre>
<p>This makes any necessary changes to the database tables. Because there may be
data already present in the database the migration scripts are needed to make
the appropriate changes that are required.  The migration tools make this 
process robust and reliable.</p>
<h3>Make Migrations</h3>
<p>When you run the <strong>makemigrations</strong> command script, code is created that is
used to update the tables in the database.  These scripts modify both the 
content and structure of the tables.  These migration scripts are now a part
of your project history and should be placed under version control.</p>
<p>For our blog demo we have the following files.</p>
<pre><code>blog/migrations
├── 0001_initial.py
├── 0002_blog_author_article.py
</code></pre>
<p>Later these files will be moved to a different server and applied to the new
database with the <strong>migrate</strong> command.  This is how the multiple databases are
kept in sync as the code is being modified on different machines by  different
authors.   The migration scripts are written so that they can be merge together
and  modify the tables in a consistent way.</p>
<h3>Production Database</h3>
<p>Before release you should setup a commercial database such as Postgres to 
manage your database.  All service providers have a mechanism to manage
databases for your application.  These typically cost extra money and require
a certain amount of setup.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will look at the details of how to work with a production
database and bring data into tables to populate the database content.
We will also look at the details of creating a database at Digital Ocean.
All service providers will provide similar methods but the details will very.
This might be instructive if you are using another providers, but is a recipe
that will get you fully up and running at Digital Ocean.</p>
<h3>Data Fixtures</h3>
<p>Django also provides a mechanism to export objects from the database.  These
objects can be a subset of all the records in the database.  The <strong>dumpdata</strong>
command can be used to collect database content as a JSON file.</p>
<p>The Django command, <strong>loaddata</strong> can be used to bring data saved as JSON into
the active database.  This is very helpful to let you export and import data
to and from the running application.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that as the app is running the data records are changing constantly.
This means that the JSON that you save will contain conflicting objects if you
allow the database to be modified.  For the import to be successful there must
not be any conflicting IDs on the data objects.</p>
<p>Data fixtures are quite useful for setting up specific test scenarios.  Each
time you want to run a test you can force a certain state in the database and
then execute the test using the known state.</p>
<h3>Save Data From Database</h3>
<p>Export the data</p>
<pre><code>$ python manage.py dumpdata
</code></pre>
<p>Send data to file</p>
<pre><code>$ python manage.py dumpdata &gt; data.json
</code></pre>
<p>Apply formatted for readability</p>
<pre><code>$ python manage.py dumpdata --indent 4 &gt; data.json
</code></pre>
<h3>Load Data Into Database</h3>
<pre><code>$ python manage.py loaddata data.json

Installed 46 object(s) from 1 fixture(s)
</code></pre>
