<h2>Building Views</h2>
<p>In chapter 4 we introduced the basics of constructing view:  including
create templates, URL routes, and view classes to work with data.  Since then
we have been practicing these skills.  Now we are ready to add the abilty to
build much more complex views.</p>
<p>Create views that follow these common design patterns to minimize the effort
required to build the code.  Each pattern can be applied in a few minutes to
produce a predictable result.  It is is worth practicing with these patterns
until you can complete the work without really thinking about it.  Better yet
build yourself an application that contains these pattern and replicate the
code directly as needed.</p>
<p>Each of these design patterns can be used to easily address specific situations
that commonly occur.  The simple view patterns are at the core of most pages
you need to build.  Occasionally the complex view patterns solve unique 
problems quickly and minimize the thinking required.</p>
<h2>Page Theme View</h2>
<p>The efficiently build the views for an application we will employ a series of
tricks.  The first idea is to build a template that will be used for all of the
pages on our website.  This puts most of code that determines the look-and-feel
of our app into a single place.</p>
<p>This base template will be used on every page by extending the template and 
customizing the content for each unique page.  The base template will be 
responsible for the overall page layout and common items, such as navbar, header,
and footer.</p>
<p>A theme page offers the complete implementation of style and content structure
for an entire website.   Major changes can be made to the look-and-feel of the
whole application by modifying this one file.</p>
<p>Consider using partial templates to make the code more readable. This theme 
has separate templates for:</p>
<ul>
<li>navbar</li>
<li>header</li>
<li>footer</li>
</ul>
<h2>Defining the Content Block</h2>
<p>Each page on the site will start by extending the base theme template and
defining a content block</p>
<pre><code> {% extends 'theme.html' %}

 {% block content %}
    &lt;h1&gt;No block defined&lt;/h1&gt;
 {% endblock content %}
</code></pre>
<p>The content block for a could range from simple pure HTML, to HTML with some
simple variable logic, to a very complex layout with a large amount of data
provided.</p>
<h3>Simple Views</h3>
<p>Simple views provide one level of abstraction.  They wrap some HTML code in
a wrapper that adds some attributes to the page.  These simple views could be
added directly using a small amount of HTML code.  The benefit of using a
design pattern is that the resulting code is more readable and duplication 
is eliminated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Page View</li>
<li>Card View</li>
<li>Document View</li>
<li>Table View</li>
<li>Html Static Pages</li>
</ul>
<h3>Complex Views</h3>
<p>Complex views are built by putting together many simple view constructs. 
When complete these pages may contain over 1000 lines of HTML code.  It is 
very important to create pages using these design patterns. Complex pages that
are built from raw HTML and JavaScript are all but unreadable.</p>
