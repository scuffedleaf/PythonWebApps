<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This chapter will explore the best practices of software engineering.  When programmers
first start their career they focus entirely on the art of programming.  This involves
writing code and debugging and testing it.  The initial challenge of development is to 
create code reliably and productively.</p>
<p>All developers soon realize that this is not enough to succeed as an engineer.  There are
a lot of skills that are required beyond writing code.  There is an entire field of software
engineering that deals with the process of how to develop software.  While learning the key
technologies is important it is also critical to master the disciplines of engineering.</p>
<h2>Design Patterns</h2>
<p>The practices of software engineering are built on several major concepts that will be
explored in detail later in this chapter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Skill 40 - Software Lifecycle</li>
<li>Skill 41 - Planning Grid</li>
<li>Skill 42 - Client Website</li>
</ul>
<h2>Concepts</h2>
<h3>Software Lifecycle</h3>
<p>Every software project will go through a series of phases.  During each phase the developers
must take on a different mindset to deal with the unique decisions that must be made to make
progress.  </p>
<p>The four main development phases of any project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements - understand the business and technical requirement</li>
<li>Design - create a plan for how the solution will use the technology</li>
<li>Code - implement the code with all of its features</li>
<li>Test - ensure that the code works under all conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>Thirty years ago the practices of engineering were defined by the conceptual model of
the Waterfall Software Lifecycle.
This model teaches that each phase of the lifecycle should be completed before proceeding
to the next.  Once a plan was put in place there was tremendous resistance to changing 
the plan.</p>
<p>Project failure was common as teams refused to adapt to new knowledge gained by doing the
project.  The most important decisions were made with the least amount of knowledge and
then cast in concrete.  As a result many projects (as high as 50%) failed to deliver on
the primary business goals by release.</p>
<p>2021 a group of software methodologists (each promoting their own methodologies) decided
to pull their efforts and develop a standard alternative that could be used by everyone.
This become known as Agile Software which is now recognized as the only reasonable way 
to develop software.</p>
<h3>Agile Manifesto</h3>
<p>Values of Agile Sofware</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
</ul>
<p>Principles behind the Agile Manifesto</p>
<p>We follow these principles:</p>
<p>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.</p>
<p>Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.</p>
<p>Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.</p>
<p>Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.</p>
<p>The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.</p>
<p>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</p>
<p>Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</p>
<p>Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.</p>
<p>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.</p>
<p>The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.</p>
<p>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.</p>
<h3>The New Lifecycle</h3>
<p>The phases of the Waterfall Lifecycle were believed to be serial activities.
While the phases of development remain the same: Requirements, Design, Code,
Test, they are believed to be overlapping activities.</p>
<p>The activities and focus remain the same.  What is different is that the next
phase will produce knowledge that will change the current phase of focus.
Feedback is given to earlier phases and changes are made.  For example: During
coding design problems are discovered that require changing the initial designs
that were made.  Sometimes there are even features that are added and removed
during coding that force a replanning of the requirements.</p>
<p>Being agile means being flexible.  Everything is flexible: requirements, design,
code, tests, deployment.  The world is constantly changing, so our software
must be aware of this change and take advantage of the growing knowledge. This
brings us to the next important concept.</p>
<h3>Incremental Development</h3>
<p>Traditionally software projects were done as one big lump.  Many developers
would work on the code and progress would occur in many areas at once.  Late
in the project all of the parts would be integrated together and testing
would be performed.  This time in the project was typically a nightmare with
all of the incompatibilities and debugging that could take weeks or months 
to resolve.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is now recognized as engineering malpractice.  Now developers
are expected to work on one feature at a time and make steady progress
throughout the project, rather than have times of panic requiring superhuman
effort to be expended.</p>
<p>To complete a features requires that it experience the full set of activities
within the lifecycle: Requirements, Design, Code, Test.  It also requires that
every feature be integrated into the system before moving on.  This totally
eliminates the panic of projects from the past.</p>
<h3>Linear progress</h3>
<p>If a project is done correctly, it requires that consistent effort be applied
throughout to produce constant progress.  While the entire system will undergo
the focused activities, each feature also will move through these same
activities. With feedback from every part of the work being taken into account
by adjusting the project plans and expectations.</p>
<h3>Milestones</h3>
<p>Milestone should be defined to mark the overall progress of the project. The
milestone should have objective criteria that reflects the tangible progress
of work accomplished.  Never change the criteria.</p>
<p>You need at least four milestones for any size project to cover each of the 
main phases. While no task is ever totally done there is a point where the
area of focus has become stable and ready to move to the next phase.</p>
<p>Here are a few Milestones you can start with.</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements Complete</li>
<li>Design Complete</li>
<li>Code Complete</li>
<li>Test Complete</li>
</ul>
<p>For larger project you may choose to define more milestones to mark your progress.  You should not have more than eight because you are introducing
too much overhead for your project.</p>
