### Review

* Django provides reusable code
    * "Batteries Included" philosophy
    * At least 1000 years of software development
    * Opinionated framework
* Skills 
    * 7 - Create a Django App
    * 8 - Create Template View
    * 9 - Add Variables to View 
* Projects
    * Setup development tools
    * Web Hosting at Digital Ocean
    * Create basic Django app


### Expand from the Basics

* Work incrementally
* Development workflow
    * Pull
    * Change/Test loop
    * Commit/Deploy changes
    * Test remotely


### Applications = Views + Data + Tests

Views present content  (Chapter 4)

* Defines all of the view logic as a Python object class
* Override any behavior you wish
* TemplateView shows an HTML template as a view
* Design patterns for custom Django views
* URL Routes Map the request to the Python code for the View

Data stores content  (Chapter 5)

* Allows database operations to be written in Python
* Python Classes modify the database structure
* Migrate the database tables after changing Models

Tests guarantee that everything works  (Chapter 8)

* Setup Django tests to check key items in your app
* Run Django tests regularly (at least once a day)
* Build tests as you write code


### views.py

The views are  Python code that converts a request into a response. The
request may contain data that is used to create the appropriate response.
The view logic is responsible for doing all of the action required to form
the response.  It may need to interact with the database, render templates,
or perform computing.


### urls.py

The web server listens for HTTP requests being made to specific host addresses.
It then matches specific requests to certain URLs.  Once a URL pattern is 
matched the server calls the appropriate view to get the HTTP response which is
returned to the requester over the internet.  The urls.py file contains a list
of URLs and views.


### templates

Django makes heavy use of HTML.  Most views will use an HTML file and add
some dynamic data. Often views do nothing more than inject data into a template
and return the resulting HTML with the appropriate HTTP headers attached. The
HTML templates are stored in files that are loaded at run time by specific views.


### Beyond Simple Views

You know the basics elements of a Django application. But there is still a
lot more to learn in order to build large and complex pages. 

One major problem that must be addressed is how to eliminate duplicated code.
When we write HTML code there is no easy way to deal with massive duplication.
Django defines a clean solution for dealing with duplicated code within our 
HTML files.  

Visual inheritance lets us define a page in HTML and extend it in other pages
rather than replicate the contents.  It will allow us to define each HTML 
construct once and reuse it in many places.

We also need to understand some details about how the templates are located
and used by our app.  And finally, this chapter will cover how to build views
with more complex data in them.

We need to add several skills to be productive.
