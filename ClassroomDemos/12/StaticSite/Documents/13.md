## Overview

Modern software is typically deployed on servers in the cloud.   This requires
careful planning and execution of the deployment.  This operations focus is quite 
unique from the mindset to develop the software that is deployed.

Traditionally Development and Operations were two separate parts of the organization
and managed somewhat independently.  Modern organizations recognize the need to combine
these distinct mindsets into a single integrated approach.

DevOps is the strategic merger of the Development team with the Operations team.  This
combined focus has all of the key elements of each process coupled so that delays 
can be eliminated and communication can be enhanced.


## Design Patterns

There are several design patterns that will help us to be more efficient in DevOps.

* Code Generator
* Continuous Integration
* DevOps Practices


## Concepts

### Combine Development and Operations

Development has a lifecycle that moves from Requirements to Coding to Testing before
the software is released.  Operations moves the code from Deployment to Scaling to
Monitoring after the release.  The key idea of DevOps is to streamline the integration
of these two lifecycles by adding key connections between them.

Special attention is given to the way that the software development team helps with
the initial deployment.  This falls in two main areas.  The development occurs on computers
that are as close as possible to the production environment.  This eliminates
the mystery bugs that surface only in production.  

Everything is kept under version control and highly automated. This includes
the machine configuration and all of the testing.  In the past these tasks were 
done by hand and highly unreliable.  DevOps requires us to automated the entire
process so that code can be fully deployed from a single command.  This ensures
that it is done the same way every time.


### Just Enough Process

Building a large project requires a lot of planning and good DevOps process.
This process should be built on proven techniques and tools that support the
required tasks.

Advanced tools are available for every unique aspect of a software project.
On small projects engineers are likely to neglect DevOps and concentrate only
on the Development part of the overall process.  This is a mistake that may 
cost you in productivity and quality.

While a small project does not require the powerful tools and more formal 
process of a large one, it can still benefit from the DevOps mindset.  The
goal is to figure out the appropriate level of process for your project.
The kind of process and tools that you use should match the size of your project.
If your project is expected to cost more than 1,000 hours of engineering then
you should invest in learning the top-self tools.

But what about the small project? I recommend that you still think through the
idea DevOps.  Apply the ideas in this chapter and reap the benefits in productivity
and quality.


### Software Reuse

Use the lowest cost approach to create the application that is needed to 
meet the business goals.  Try to avoid writing software by finding and using
software that already exists.   Cultivate the mindset of software reuse in
all of its forms.

Consider these layers of reuse.

* Buy a product that exists
* Buy a component that solve certain core problems
* Use a general-purpose framework 
* Build your own framework by refactoring your code
* Recycle pieces of apps you wrote
* Write custom software from scratch


### Refactoring

All design have limitations.  When code is first designed there is often little known about the 
actual problem that must be solved.  Designers make choices that seem right at the time but inevitably
lead to constraints in the features and structure of the system.

As code is modified it undergoes decay.  Each time the code is edited, its quality is decreased.  As the
design needs change the existing design become increasingly inappropriate.  Large systems often decay
to a point where they need to be replace entirely to meet the business goals.

Over time the design limits the new features that can be added.  At the start of a project very little
is known about the problems to be solved.  But as the project goes on knowledge is gained that makes
appropriate design trade-offs clear.

Many companies resist changing the design once it is in place.  This locks them into trade-offs that 
may be entirely inappropriate.  The world is constantly changing.  It is critical to have a flexible
design that can adapt to the new realities.

Refactoring allows design to change after the code has been written.  All design must change over time
and refactoring is the technique that allows you to update the design after the initial decisions are 
Code decays; refactoring saves.

The design of your code should be a simple as possible.  Junior engineers often overbuild everything.
They anticipate what might be needed.  Do not anticipate - wait for the need.  Refactoring lets you
morph a simple design to the next level rather than build it ahead of time.
Engineer the system on demand, not prematurely.


### Application Frameworks

Most of the problem that need to be solved are common problems.  As these problems surface code
is created to meet the needs.  It is important to standardize the best solution found and apply
this solution every time the problem recurs.  Great engineers solve problems once and reuse
the solution as needed.

Each time the standard solution is applied, improvements are made to generalize it or add new
functionality.  Over time a truly excellent solution can be developed that lets you solve the
problem with very little thought.

This is the idea behind an application framework.  Django was developed by writing around ten 
applications and then refactoring all of the common parts into a library of reusable code.  Over
the years Django has been improved by the contributions of thousands of applications.  The
best thinking of a large army of application developers is reflected in the Django framework.

This is the most powerful type of software reuse imaginable.  In a few minutes you can build a
robust application that benefits from 1,000 years of engineering.


### Rules to Live By

We hold these truths to be self-evident.  Good dev ops requires that
you do not violate these basic practices.

* Let business needs drive development
* Automate all testing
* Develop with production configuration
* Communicate frequently
* Everything is under version control
* Build the world from scratch
* Fix problems immediately
