## Overview

Throughout this book we have been focused on technology.  What are design
patterns for building the parts of the apps we desire?  Now we will shift
our attention to the process that we will use to build apps.  What practices
should be used to implement any project that we work on?

To develop software we must understand not only the technology involved but
the process for defining, designing, implementing, and testing the code. This
chapter will look at how we build software effectively. 

Define a standard process for software development and use it each time to do
your projects.  Every project requires at least four different mindsets.  
People tend to be strong in some areas and weak in others. So they focus on
the part of the process they enjoy.  Have the discipline to cover all aspects
of the software project well and you life will be much easier.

* Gather requirements for the problem to solve
* Design the solution
* Implement the solution
* Test the solution


## Design Patterns

There are four basic tasks that must be done.  We have touched on all of these
areas in this book, but concentrated mostly on writing the code.  This chapter
will broaden our perspective to encompass the entire process.

* Requirements
* Design
* Coding
* Test


## Concepts


### Gathering Requirements

At the start of every project you must understand the business goals before you
can understand the technical goals to be pursued.  There are three fundamental
tradeoffs that must be prioritized on each project. You must know the relative
importance to the client.  Most projects I work on have the following order.

* Schedule
* Functionality/Quality
* Cost

Always divide up the work into milestones that are roughly equal in the amount
of effort required.  This lets you make steady progress and measure the progress
against the expectations.  This one practice lets you make adjustments before
it is critical to stay on track.

Our goal is to make steady linear progress throughout the project.  We must
avoid scheduling that requires a superhuman effort at some point in the project.
If we are not meeting the expectation we must know early

The client must be a key part of the project.  A weekly review session will
reveal many disconnects and misunderstandings.  Make this a required part of 
every project.  Demonstrate the weekly progress and ask for feedback.  Then
change the project based on the feedback.


### Initial Design

Choose the best tools for the project that you are working on.  Django is a
nice tool for a wide-variety of web apps.  But if you can find a tool that 
already solves the customer problems then you may be able to avoid writing
code at all.  The cheapest software you deliver is the software you don't 
write.  Try to find a solution that someone else already developed.

The most important design decision is the choice of tools that you build your
solution upon.  Give careful thought to this choice.  All tools have a learning
curve.  If you already know a tool well then you have already paid this price.
If not you will need to pay for the learning as go and it will be significantly
more than you expect.

Learning new tools is about learning specific tricks.  Each trick takes about
a day to learn because you must find all of the ways it won't work. One you
know a trick well you can do it in an hour.  A web app has about 50 tricks that
you must know.  This translates into 50 days or 50 hours depending on how
many new trick you must master.

Throughout the project track the unsolved problems.  Anything that makes you
uneasy is pointing to a new trick that must be learned.  This list will help
you estimate how quickly you are resolving the new problems that emerge.

Build core functionality first.  This will prove out the basic design as 
quickly as possible.  Build prototypes to show proof that your concepts will
work.  Tackle the most difficult design challenges first.


### Design as You Go

Your first design will need to change.  When you start every project your 
understanding is very incomplete.   As your knowledge grows your designs must
adapt to the new reality.

Once you start writing code, changing the design can be very disruptive. 
Many people are tempted to avoid changing the code as much as possible.  This
creates the problem with the code logic becoming outdated with the requirements
and the design.

A core competency of engineers is learning how to change the code without 
breaking the functionality.  This practice is called refactoring and is the
most important skill of design.

Refactoring is about changing the design without breaking the code features
that are working.  Refactoring allows the code to improve and adapt over time.
This is the opposite of the natural tendency for the code to decay.

Refactoring requires that you have tests in place to make sure that the
functionality remains the same.  The goal of refactoring is to change the 
structure and design of the code without affecting the features at all.


### Balance Coding Tasks

The implementation phases of the software requires server different mindsets.
Balancing these tasks during coding is important.  It is easy to concentrate
on create features and neglect the unseen parts of the project.

Each day should have a balance of the following.

* Test - Build test code to ensure that every feature you write works properly.
Test code should account for half of the code you write.
* Fix - When you test you will find issues.  Fix them immediately before doing
anything else.  What you see may be the only symptom that you will get of a 
major flaw.
* Extend - Adding new features is the part of coding that both developers and
clients appreciate.  It is highly visible and naturally draws our attention.
The challenge is to fully appreciate the other parts of coding.
* Improve - Refactoring is what keeps the code fresh.  Improving the design
and structure of the code is the most frequently neglected part of the coding
process.  But you won't get very far unless the design adapts over time.


### Test

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is very counterintuitive and difficult for many
to accept.  But once you get the hang of it you will consider it an essential
technique for coding.

TDD starts by selecting one simple feature.  What is the simplest test that 
would indicate that the feature is not working?
Write the failing test.  This verifies that your actual test is good.  Try to
write one line of Python code to check for one simple thing.

Write enough code to pass the failing test.  Try to write one line of code that
passes the test.  Hard-code everything at first and fix it later.  Duplicate 
code at first and refactor it later.  Make it specific now and generalize it
later.

Refactor the code to fix all of the quirks that you just created.  You have
tests - you have features that work.  Now fix the structure.  Remove duplication.
If it feels skanky then is.  Generalize to simplfy, add abstraction without 
changing the behavior.  Work until this one area is perfect in functionality
and design.

Now that feature is done.  Select a new feature and repeat until done.  This
is the beauty of TDD.  It is simple and effective and lets you build with 
amazing speed and quality.


### Build out all layers

Our apps have several different layers.  Each of these layers requires a 
somewhat unique mindset.

* **App** - The app layer deals with the overall project structure.  This 
includes the web hosting infrastructure, settings, urls, views, templates,
and database connection.

* **Data** - This revolves around the data models and how the views interact
with the records in the database.

* **Views** - This involves the pages which require URLs, views, and template
code to be written.

* **Tests** - The Django test infrastructure should be used to create Page test,
Data tests, and Views test to cover all of the product code that we write.
