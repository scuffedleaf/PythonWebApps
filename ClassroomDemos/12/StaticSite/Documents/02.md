### Web Hosting Technology

Running a web application on the internet requires many layers of software and
hardware.  All of these layers must be properly integrated and working properly
before the application server can answer a single request.

In 1995 the internet was in its infancy and engineers were required to spend a
lot of time worrying about how to get their application hosted before they could
write any business logic.

* Hardware
* Operating System
* Operational Scripts for server maintenance
* Computer languages and runtime environments
* Frameworks and libraries
* Database services
* Static Web services (NGINX)
* Application Servers (Apache, Gunicorn)
* Application Business Logic


### Virtual Machines

Application developers used to host their own hardware and software in their own
data centers.  This meant having all of the physical computers in a data center
and maintaining all of the networking hardware.  This often proved to be a 
much larger problem than the development of the software.

The first breakthrough occurred by the creating of the Virtual Machine concept and
the Linux operating system.  This allowed for engineers to have much larger
machines which were all running Virtual Machines (VMs) functioning as stand alone
computers.  Linux was free to use and provided an operating system environment
to run the software on the VMs.

This concept of virtualization emerged in the mid-1990s and drove the DotCom Boom
(1995-2000).  By 2000 Amazon Web Services (AWS) had established itself as the
king of Virtual Machine hosting. Now engineers could forgo building computer
systems in favor of using AWS to provide the computer server hardware and 
software.

Soon there were many other players competing to provide similar services.  
Compared to the complexity and cost of hosting your own hardware this was
considered cheap.  Eventually this became the standard way that everyone 
embraced.


### Hosting Web Pages

The problem of hosting static web servers is much easier that the general problem
of hosting dynamic web servers.  Static web servers do not perform any business
logic on the HTTP requests coming in.  They are simply a lookup service that
returns an HTTP response that corresponds with each HTTP request.

Very cheap services (less than $5/month) propagated and allowed many businesses 
to have simple websites advertising their companies and products and provide
static information.

Another market provided users with application accounts for specific software.
It is said that WordPress software is running on two-thirds of the active servers
on the internet.  Customers would buy an account at WordPress and have a blog
running in a few minutes without ever having to deal with any hosting issues.

This all is great is either you are working with static web pages or you have
access to a vendor for a common application.  Leasing existing software running
on existing servers is always your first option for controlling complexity and
cost.


### Extending Static Pages

But what if you need more?  These solution fail to let developers host custom
applications.

A static web page can reference other computer systems which can give a static
page dynamic capability.  This is done through JavaScript logic that is embedded
in the pages.  This code is sent to the client web browser and executed by the
web browser (not on the server).

By 2000 many new applications were running with heavy JavaScript payloads that
provided dynamic capability while running on a static web server.
THis led to the reality that we have today characterized by:

* Server-side logic referred to as Back-end Development (Python, C#, Java, JavaScript)
* Client-side logic referred to as Front-end Development (JavaScript)
* Full-stack Developers work on both sides 

To build a fully custom app, we can choose between a balance of Server-side
of Client-side development.  Powerful frameworks have emerged on both sides to 
make development easier.

* Server Frameworks
    * Node JS (written in JavaScript)
    * .Net Framework (Written in C#)
    * Rails (written in Ruby)
    * Laravel (written in PHP)
    * Django (written in Python)
* Client Frameworks
    * Vue.js (written in JavaScript)
    * React (written in JavaScript)
    * Angular (written in JavaScript)

All of these frameworks are powerful and capable of producing good results but
they all have steep learning curves.  Pick one and become an expert.  If you 
invest in several, you will spread yourself too thin and never achieve the 
competency that make you competitive in the workplace.


### Hosting Provider

A major reason that developers choose to minimize back-end development is that
it requires the Application Hosting provider to support certain capabilities.
Depending on the provider, this is can be a big deal.

This picture has seen radical improvements in the last few years.  We now have
excellent solutions that are easy to setup and require no ongoing maintenance.

Ten years ago hosting a web application server running Django
would require you to spend many hours setting up and maintaining all aspects
of your platform infrastructure.   Consider the following scenario:

* AWS account services 
* Virtual Machine setup
* Domain registration and DNS routing
* Linux (Ubuntu 2022.04 LTS)
* Python (version 3.10.4)
* Django (version 4.0.4)
* SSL certificate and renewal

Not only is there a lot to do to keep the system running but there is a lot 
to learn.  Developers spent hundreds of hours trying to get the server 
infrastructure running.  It was hard to get going and hard to keep it going
properly.  DevOps emerged as a full-time job between development and operations.


### Docker

Before you could go live you needed to have dedicated expertise in DevOps.  
This was extremely costly and took much of the fun out of software development.

Docker introduced the notion of a Container in 2015 that would simplify how
we installed and maintained application components.
Similar to a Virtual Machine, Docker Containers can capture an entire ecosystem
that can be loaded into memory or stored as needed.

Many web hosting company soon adopted Docker containers as a way of getting system
components up and running quickly.  But the task remained to maintain the 
service infrastructure.


### Digital Ocean

Digital Ocean emerged as a early leader for hosting Django applications.  
They greatly simplified how developers would get the code running.

Working at AWS or Google App Engine involved building all of the components 
starting with the Virtual Machine,  Operating System, Python, Django, Postgres, 
DNS routing, SSL registration and renewal.  There were many services that were
offered (often with additional fees).  The ultimate cost of operations was
sometimes staggering.

Configuring web hosting at Digital Ocean involved create a Droplet (based
on Docker Container).  This Droplet contained all the platform infrastructure that
was required to run a Django application. 

Now it was finally possible to create a Platform as a Service (PaaS) environment
to host a Django application in hours not days.  The engineer is still in full
control of all of the details of each layer of the infrastructure and can tweet
anything in the stack.

* Operating System
* Python 3.10
* Django 
* MySQL database
* Droplets
* Docker containers


### App Platform

In 2019 Digital Ocean introduced another giant leap forward. App Platform is
built on top of the Droplet technology and understands the type of application
that you are trying to deploy.  It does all of the application setup for you
automatically and provides ongoing management of all your infrastructure.

It supports all of the major types of apps with new ones introduced regularly.

* Node JS 
* .Net Framework 
* Rails 
* Laravel 
* Django
* Vue.js
* React
* Angular

App Platform provides a GUI to build your server platform. You interactively 
select your choices and it builds up and deploys what you need to run your app.
Now application deployment can be done in minutes not hours.

Automatic maintenance of platform includes: Operating System, Python, Package
Libraries, and Database. You can even point domains at the app and get an SSL
certificate automatically registered.

Each time you commit changes to your Github account the application environment
is completely rebuilt on the server from scratch.  If it fails then the last
good version is redeployed so your app keeps running after you push bad code.


### App Platform Costs

At the time of this writing you can register for a new account at Digital 
Ocean and get $100 credit. Service costs are extremely low and there are not
add on fees.  Other hosting providers seem to have a lot of hidden costs.

* Static Server - Free
* Django App - $5/month  
* Database - $7/month

The rest of this book will assume that you are using App Platform at Digital
Ocean.  Of course you are free to use any web hosting service that you choose.
The textbook will provide simple instructions for getting your server up and
running.


### Static Web Server

Our first task will be to build static web server at Digital Ocean.  Skill #3
will walk through the steps that you need to perform to get your static server
running.

A static server will receive HTTP requests and lookup the appropriate file to
return as and HTTP response.  No interesting business logic is performed by
the server.  Static servers may support many types of files.

* HTML files
* JavaScript files (which run on client)
* Images
* Video


### Single Page Apps

Many of these files may contain code that will execute inside the client web
browser.  All modern web browsers contain a JavaScript engine for executing the
front-end code.  By using a JavaScript Front-end Framework (such as Angular,
Vue, or React) complex applications can be created.

These apps can be deployed as static websites.  And Digital Ocean provides free
static websites for  deployment.  This may be of interest for certain types of 
applications.


### Static Site Generators

Sometimes sophisticated processing is required to create a set of web assets that
can become static when served.   A static site generator can be be used to 
perform the initial business logic including access to data and invoking other
computers.  All of this work is built into a website or collection of assets
that can be delivered to the clients through a static web server.

If you are interested in this topic consider learning about Gatsby, Hugo, and
Jekyll.  Building a static site using one of these apps can greatly speed up
the delivery of content.  And Digital Ocean provides free static websites for 
deployment.


### CDN

A static web server is essentially a lookup service.  When an HTTP request is 
received a suitable HTTP response is created and returned.  A given request will
always be answered with the same response.  This makes it possible to cache the
responses in either the server or the client.  Instead of looking up the file
a known response is automatically found in the cache and used.

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is used by Digital Ocean to implement the
static web server.  This has built in caching to speed up the responses and
reduce the computation that is required.  The CDN is extremely fast at answering
the requests.


## Deployment Using App Platform

Before any of our work goes public we must set up the server infrastructure
at our service provider.  We will be using Digital Ocean for this book since
it is easy to get up and running quickly, while giving us the ability to scale
later.

We will be doing the deployment in three separate phases so that you can learn
each skill before worrying about the next.

* Deploy a Static Web Server - Skill 4
* Deploy a Development Application Server - Skill 5
* Deploy a Production Application Web Server - Skill 6


### Deploy a Static Web Server - (details in Skill 4)

The first step in deployment is to build a static website that is live on the
internet.  This web server will answer HTTP requests and produce HTTP responses.
It will provide a direct mapping from request to response but will not execute
any custom business logic or handle data.

Static servers will handle files of many types: Images, Videos, CSS, HTML,
JavaScript.  Our Django Application will use a static web server to handling 
all of the static asset in a secure way.


###  Deploy a Development Application Server - Skill 5

Once you have mastered how to create a static web server you are ready to take
it to the next level.  The process for creating an application server at Digital
Ocean is similar but adds several new configuration steps.

During development we are far more concerned with getting our application running
properly than we are about security.  That changes as our code goes into production.
When real users are depending on a service we must make sure that the server
is secure and robust.  This is not hard to do but absolutely essential.

Using App Platform we can quickly create a new server in a few minutes.  If 
needed we can destroy the server and recreate it at any time, based on the
configuration data from the existing server.  This acts as a recipe that can 
be used to create new applications as needed.

This guide (Skill 5) will walk you through the process step-by-step and show
you specific settings that are needed.  Follow the guide until you feel 
confident to go "off road" by yourself.  There is nothing sacred about these
details but they have been chosen with care to give you a "quick win".


### Django Execution Environment

Before you can deploy an application to the internet you must first get it 
running properly on your local computer.  We need to make our development 
environment as similar as possible to the production environment.
In practice, this comes down to four issues:

* Python version that runs our code
* Django and other Python package versions
* Database connection
* Environment variables

Each of these issues could be different between development and production.
This allows bugs to leak into our production environment unnoticed.  Our goal
will be to minimize the differences so that testing on the development environment
applies directly to production.


### Django App Hosting

Next, we must learn to deploy an application that is already running successfully
on our local computer.

Configuring a top-level Django application at App Platform requires several
activities.

* App Platform application
* Django App Server
* Static Asset Server
* Database Server

We will look at each of these one at a time to ensure that the application
is fully configured and operational.


### App Platform application

App Platform provides all the infrastructure that is needed to run an
application. Creating a new top-level application can be done in a few minutes. 
There are a number of configuration options that are all specified when we
create the application.

The Digital Ocean website is used to create a new app and get the options set
properly.  Details for creating a new app are provided by Skill #7.  Here is a
summary of the overall process to guide you.


### Django App Source Code

When creating a new app the first thing that needs to be defined is the location
of the source code. This is the top-level of the Django application that is
being deployed.  The directory specified contains the "manage.py" file.

We will set up the App Platform Service to watch a specific Git repo for changes.
When this code changes a new build will be performed.  When successful a new
deployment will be done and the web application server will be restarted.

If anything fails then the previous build is redeployed to guarantee that there
is no down time.  You want a bad build to fail so that it is not deployed.  
You will get a notification of the failure and will be able to troubleshoot the
problem.

Resources

* Git Repo:  <your-name>/BACS350.git
* Branch: main
* Source Directory: week3/Superhero
* Autodeploy


### Static Asset Server

Create Resource

* Git Repo:  <your-name>/BACS350.git
* Branch: main
* Source Directory: week3/Superhero/static
* HTTP Request Routes: /static
* Output Directory: leave blank


### Settings: Environment Variables

App Platform uses environment variables to control the build, deployment, and
even the runtime behavior of the application.  These values can be set at either
the application or component level.  We will set several App-level Environment 
Variables that will be accessed by each component.

Add the following key/value pairs

    DEBUG = 1
    DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1

DEBUG changes the behavior of the hosted application so that it can be easily
debugged.  The main thing that you will notice is the yellow debug screen that
appears when the applications gets an error.  Turn on debugging during 
development and turn it off later.

DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC is used to tell the build process not to collect all of 
the static data for hosting on the static server.  Later we will change this
behavior but it is OK for now.


###  Deploy a Production Application Web Server - Skill 6

Moving from development into production forces a new mindset.  This is reflected
in the way that the servers are configured.  App Platform provides an easy 
transition to more advanced security.

All of the code has already been written an lie within the Django Framework.
The specific features needed can be enabled to handle the new way of doing things.

These new requirements are enabled by variables located in the Django
"settings.py" file.  We will use Shell variables in App Platform to let us config
options as desired.

The settings file will read these Shell variables to enable features within the 
Django code. This process allows us to control the Django  application without having to change
the Python source code.  Setting the Environment Variables is done through the
App Platform settings.


### Environment Variables

App Platform uses environment variables to control the build, deployment, and
even the runtime behavior of the application.  These values can be set at either
the application or component level.  We will set several App-level Environment 
Variables that will be accessed by each component.

Add the following key/value pairs

    DEBUG = 1
    DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1
    DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOST = .ondigitalocean.app
    DEVELOPMENT_MODE = 1

Changing a few lines in config/settings.py lets us read and use the values set
in the Environment Variables.

**config/settings.py**

    from os import getenv

    DEBUG = True

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = getenv("DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS", "127.0.0.1")


### Database Server

App Platform will connect our application to our database.  Later we will 
configure a database for our production server, but it is not needed at this 
time.   

For now we will have Django configure a development database automatically when
the code is deployed.  This will work well for testing out our code but every
new deployment will create a brand new database.  This will cause all the data
to be lost and will need to be fixed.

We will use an environment variable to determine whether we want to use a
real database or the automatic database for testing.

    DEVELOPMENT_MODE = "True"

In settings.py we will check this variable to see which database to use.  In
Chapter 5 we will begin working with real data so we will need to create a real
database that persists through deployment of the application.  At that time we
will revisit how we connect to the database.




### App Spec



### Django Application
* Python code (URL routes, Views, Database, Business Logic)
* Maps each request to a response
* Executes Python code


### Database Setup


### Database
* Minimal cost $12/month for database
* Use development database (until week 4)
* Data will be destroyed during deployment


### Deploy a Development Application Server - (details in Skill 5)


### Deploy a Production Application Web Server - (details in Skill 6)



### Ready to Deploy

Deploying an application at Digital Ocean is quite easy. You can specific a
Github repo with a branch and a path.  Configuring the App Platform is done
by looking at the source code that you specified.  To deploy a static site you 
need a file at the root.

    index.html

Deploying a Django app requires that you have

    requirements.txt
    runtime.txt

runtime.txt declares the version of Python.

    python-3.10.4

requirements.txt declares the Python packages to install.

    asgiref
    Django
    gunicorn
    pytz
    sqlparse
    whitenoise
    dj-database-url


### Commit to Deploy

After you create your application, App Platform continues to watch your Github
repo, branch, and path.  When the new code changes are committed to this 
code a build process is automatically started.


### Build Process

A build command that you configure controls the behavior of this build process.
Both the static server and the dynamic application server let you run scripts
to organize and prepare the content to be ready to be served.

For a Django app the default command knows how to compile all the code for the
deployment.  You don't need to change anything here.


### Run Command

After a successful build the server is started up.  For a static website this
means moving the content to a CDN.  You do not perform any action in order to
make publish the content onto the internet.  

For a Django app it is important that you migrate the database, collect the
static data, and startup the Gunicorn web server.  You need to specify where 
the web server will find the Python application code.  Check out Skill #5 for 
details.
